This is a Ruby on Rails project making a social media site clone applying knowledge learned. 
Things I am looking forward to:
* Testing the application
* Trying out omni auth
* Finding a unique spin that makes the project special
* Getting the database design done

## TODO
* Notifications for each new follow, comment, posts from followees
* Add pagination for, comments, then pagination for follower and users search result
* Populated comments and replies slow down page significantly
## Featured Bugs
* Weird turbo bug where a form is generated in a different way when replying for the second time
