# Odinbook

[Project Link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project)

This is a Ruby on Rails project making a social media site clone applying knowledge learned. 
Things I am looking forward to:
* Testing the application
* Trying out omni auth
* Finding a unique spin that makes the project special
* Getting the database design done

## TODO
* Notifications for each new follow, comment, posts from followees
* child commments also need pagination
* Find a way to access set theme in bulma so that buttons change color from '' to 'is-dark'
* Write model tests for follows for create/destroy. limit routes to necessary ones only. Important for user     authorization.
* stimulus components: character counter, Stimulus Timeago (better date format?), need a modal for the notifications as it is annoying and moves content.

## EXTRA TODO
* Add Posts Comments Likes Menu on user profile.

## Featured Bugs
* Weird turbo bug where a form is generated in a different way when replying for the second time
