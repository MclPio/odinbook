[Project Link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project)

This is a Ruby on Rails project making a social media site clone applying knowledge learned. 
Things I am looking forward to:
* Testing the application
* Trying out omni auth
* Finding a unique spin that makes the project special
* Getting the database design done

## TODO
* Notifications for each new follow, comment, posts from followees
* Add pagination for posts, comments
* Add icons
* Populated comments and replys slow down page significantly
* There is too much time spent on loading views, posts index page and long comment threads.

## Featured Bugs
* Weird turbo bug where a form is generated in a different way when replying for the second time
