# Odinbook

[Project Link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project)

This is a Ruby on Rails project making a social media site clone applying knowledge learned. 
Things I am looking forward to:
* Testing the application
* Trying out omni auth
* Finding a unique spin that makes the project special
* Getting the database design done

## TODO
* Notifications for each new follow, comment, posts from followees
* Turbo streams for new comment reply as it currently refreshes the page and loses scrolling position
* Add pagination for posts, comments
* Add a cancel button for reply, through stimulus controller
* Add icons
* Fix eager loading issues
